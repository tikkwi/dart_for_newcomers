## Introduction

This repository provides a cheatsheet-style reference for **Dart**, one of the most popular
programming languages used in mobile app development with Flutter. You can find quick examples and
explanations that can be referenced whenever you need them.
<br/>
As this is designed for developers who are transitioning to Dart, I won't include how to code or
basic knowledges like loops, if-else, basic operators etc.

## Getting Started

Before you dive into the cheatsheet, make sure you have Dart installed on your system. Follow the
official installation guide if needed:

[Install Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
